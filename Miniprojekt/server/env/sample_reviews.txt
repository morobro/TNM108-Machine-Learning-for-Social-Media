Review: This book needs some serious editing. There were multiple misspellings, missing words, missing spaces, etc., that made reading somewhat difficult at times. I was also a bit turned off by the formatting, which put a space between every paragraph, but this may just be a personal preference that wouldn't deter others. As for the story itself, the plot was imaginative, original and well paced, characters could have been fleshed out a tiny bit more but were decent, and overall there was a good flow. I really did like the story and will be looking into the next book in the series, I just hope that Rune Breaker will be re-edited for the sake of future readers.

Review: I just loved this Christmas story so very sweet.  Shows just what true love can do.  SWEET SWEET story.  Made me happy.

Review: I was looking through the Kindle's lender library to find something light, funny and romantic to read and this hit the spot. It was not too long and I finished it quickly probably because it was hard to put down. I wanted to know more about Reggie and her life and was drawn into it. I like YA novels (being a high school teacher myself) maybe because I see kids like Reggie and Sam all the time. I would probably give it a 4.5 stars but I'll round up...definitely worth a read! :)

Review: This book was great for me, loaded with tips that I can use on a regular basis. Is now part of my business library of tools.

Review: I didn't really hate it;it just didn't grab my attention so I didn't finish it; I didn't feel it would get any better

Review: Seriously???? What the heck was that? This book was totally lame.  You get into it and you have to purchase another book to find out what happens. Total waste of time.

Food

Review: My daughter loves Earth's Best food items but after two broken shipments from Amazon, I decided to buy from the grocery store.  I sent an email to Amazon but my issue was never resolved.

Review: I love this product however, the price is extremely too much.  will not buy at that price.

Review: I really like the Worthington Skallops.  They are high in protein and fiber, low in fat and carbs.  Great for weight loss and a healthy meat substitute.  I think they are on the expensive side, however.  I still buy them, as a treat or when I have extra cash in the food budget.

Review: Not that it is an earth-shattering mistake, but instead of receiving what I ordered (chocolate gummy bears) I received a bag of chocolate coffee beans. Not really worth my time to go through the return process and mistakes do happen. lesson learned.

Review: its the best gummy bears in the world,when you stick one of them in your mouth it feels like a million dollars
